The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n","Objective:\n","To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n","Data Provided:\n","•\tThe theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X\n","•\tSample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050\n","•\tNumber of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 600 units and a standard deviation (σ) of 25 units\n","Assignment Tasks:\n","1.
