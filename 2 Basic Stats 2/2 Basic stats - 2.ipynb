The test to determine whether an item meets the quality standards destroys the item, leading to the requirement of small sample sizes due to cost constraints.\n","Scenario\n","A manufacturer of print-heads for personal computers is interested in estimating the mean durability of their print-heads in terms of the number of characters printed before failure. To assess this, the manufacturer conducts a study on a small sample of print-heads due to the destructive nature of the testing process.\n","Data\n","A total of 15 print-heads were randomly selected and tested until failure. The durability of each print-head (in millions of characters) was recorded as follows:\n","1.13, 1.55, 1.43, 0.92, 1.25, 1.36, 1.32, 0.85, 1.07, 1.48, 1.20, 1.33, 1.18, 1.22, 1.29\n","Assignment Tasks\n","a. Build 99% Confidence Interval Using Sample Standard Deviation\n","Assuming the sample is representative of the population, construct a 99% confidence interval for the mean number of characters printed before the print-head fails using the sample standard deviation. Explain the steps you take and the rationale behind using the t-distribution for this task.\n","b. Build 99% Confidence Interval Using Known Population Standard Deviation\n","If it were known that the population standard deviation is 0.2 million characters, construct a 99% confidence interval for the mean number of characters printed before failure.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","from scipy.stats import t, norm"],"metadata":{"id":"Qk9vR1PHddN7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","df = [1.13, 1.55, 1.43, 0.92, 1.25, 1.36, 1.32, 0.85, 1.07, 1.48, 1.20, 1.33, 1.18, 1.22, 1.29]\n","df\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Qfl5GZWRddKx"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["n = len(df)\n","n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"HFoZ6kuDeCNR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732557437462,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":450,"user":{"displayName":"Amrutraj b","userId":"15166051471585799004"}},"outputId":"19d0f716-c887-4220-8759-efb4a703ae26"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["15"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Calculating the sample mean\n","sample_mean = np.mean(df)"],"metadata":{"id":"TF_Me0_BeNmy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Calculating Sample standard deviation\n","sample_std_dev = np.std(df, ddof=1)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7GAfZ9cPddCC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Part a: 99% Confidence Interval Using Sample Standard Deviation (t-distribution)\n","alpha = 0.01  # for 99% confidence interval\n","t_critical = t.ppf(1 - alpha/2, df=n-1)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AF4aMR7Kdl49"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["margin_of_error_a = t_critical * (sample_std_dev / np.sqrt(n))\n","confidence_interval_a = (sample_mean - margin_of_error_a, sample_mean + margin_of_error_a)"],"metadata":{"id":"ChNvSw0QlEJR"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["confidence_interval_a = (sample_mean - margin_of_error_a, sample_mean + margin_of_error_a)"],"metadata":{"id":"mVwZ1Y3plFUQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Part b: 99% Confidence Interval Using Known Population Standard Deviation (z-distribution)\n","z_critical = norm.ppf(1 - alpha/2)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"97DGv2tudl2B"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["margin_of_error_b = z_critical * (pop_std_dev / np.sqrt(n))\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4r5KTe93lPag"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["confidence_interval_b = (sample_mean - margin_of_error_b, sample_mean + margin_of_error_b)"],"metadata":{"id":"LLbTlfdylPTv"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4oBxMUSndPtg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732557349930,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"Amrutraj b","userId":"15166051471585799004"}},"outputId":"ea812d40-372a-4e29-d46f-2b5cc6bbb0b5"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Sample Mean: 1.2386666666666666\n","Sample Standard Deviation: 0.19316412956959936\n","99% Confidence Interval using sample standard deviation (t-distribution): (1.0901973384384906, 1.3871359948948425)\n","99% Confidence Interval using known population standard deviation (z-distribution): (1.1056514133957607, 1.3716819199375725)\n"]}],"source":["\n","# Output the results\n","print(\"Sample Mean:\", sample_mean)\n","print(\"Sample Standard Deviation:\", sample_std_dev)\n","print(\"99% Confidence Interval using sample standard deviation (t-distribution):\", confidence_interval_a)\n","print(\"99% Confidence Interval using known population standard deviation (z-distribution):\", confidence_interval_b)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ZJvqUys4dPtn"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"54ellYzBdPtp"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8aYXHD5vdPtr"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.4"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1elXOvRahFWVGtOxU2MmQwILTJtVzJaHZ","timestamp":1732559350594},{"file_id":"1YMp_gKNw7fXo6apBmLxJQ6e4c4uqK4LT","timestamp":1732559203488}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
