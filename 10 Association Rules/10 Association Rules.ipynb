The most commonly used metrics are support, confidence, and lift, but there are many others that capture different aspects of the rules, such as interest, conviction, leverage, and novelty. Choosing the right metrics depends on the domain, the goal, and the data characteristics.\n","\n","2: Setting the appropriate thresholds\n","Another challenge in association rule mining is to set the appropriate thresholds for the metrics that are used to generate and evaluate the rules. The thresholds determine how many and which rules are extracted from the data. If the thresholds are too high, the rules may be too specific and miss some interesting patterns. If the thresholds are too low, the rules may be too general and generate too many irrelevant or redundant rules\n","\n","\n","3: Handling noise and outliers\n","A third challenge in association rule mining is to handle noise and outliers in the data. Noise and outliers are data points that deviate from the normal or expected behavior of the data. They can affect the quality and validity of the rules, as they can introduce false associations or mask true ones.\n","\n","\n","\n","4: Dealing with missing values\n","A fourth challenge in association rule mining is to deal with missing values in the data. Missing values are data points that are not recorded or available for some reason. They can affect the accuracy and completeness of the rules, as they can cause some items or transactions to be ignored or misinterpreted.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AP8pHFqt9mDn"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.4"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1l0VDCa8yGAM-ZBDaDE_wSORczVvCYHJg","timestamp":1732515583133}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
